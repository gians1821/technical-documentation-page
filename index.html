            <p class="text-content">Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. The Linux kernel serves as the foundation for various operating systems, commonly referred to as Linux distributions or simply "distros."</p>
            <p class="text-content">These distributions typically include a collection of software applications, utilities, libraries, and graphical interfaces to provide a complete operating environment.</p>
            <p class="text-content">Here are some examples of <i>distros</i>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Debian</li>
                <li>Ubuntu</li>
                <li>Kali</li>
                <li>Arch</li>

            <p class="text-content">A terminal typically refers to a text-based interface used to interact with a computer system. It's a command-line interface (CLI) where users can input commands to perform various tasks such as navigating the file system, running programs, managing files, and configuring settings.</p>
            <p class="text-content">Terminals are often found in Unix-based operating systems like Linux and macOS, although Windows also has its own command-line interface known as Command Prompt or PowerShell.</p>

        <section id="What_is_a_shell?" class="main-section">
            <header class="main-section__title">What is a shell?</header>
            <p class="text-content">A shell is a user interface for accessing an operating system's services. It's a program that takes commands from the user and translates them into instructions that the operating system can understand and execute.</p>
            <p class="text-content">Shells can be command-line interfaces (CLI), where users type commands using text, or graphical user interfaces (GUI), where users interact with the shell using graphical elements like buttons and menus.</p>
            <p class="text-content">The most common shells are the next ones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bash</li>
                <li>Zsh</li>
                <li>Powershell</li>

        <section id="What_is_Bash?" class="main-section">
            <header class="main-section__title">What is Bash?</header>
            <p class="text-content">Bash, short for "Bourne Again Shell," is a command-line interpreter and scripting language primarily used in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS.</p>
            <p class="text-content">Bash is highly customizable and extensible, offering features such as command-line editing, history support, tab completion, and the ability to define aliases and functions.</p>

            <p class="text-content">The most used commands on Linux can vary depending on the user's specific tasks and workflows. However, some of the commonly used commands across various contexts include:</p>
